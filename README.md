# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Sensor-Driven-Kinetic-Facade-System-Using-Arduino-Nano

Title: Design and Implementation of a Sensor Driven Kinetic Facade System Using Arduino Nano
Goal: To create a responsive prototype of a building facade that moves using servo motors based on environmental inputs like sunlight and rain, aimed at improving energy efficiency, comfort, and aesthetics in architectural design.

üîß Components Used
Arduino Nano ‚Äì Core microcontroller for sensing and control

Servo Motors (SG90 or MG996R) ‚Äì To physically move facade panels

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) ‚Äì For detecting ambient light intensity

Rain Sensor (YL-83 or FC-37 module) ‚Äì For detecting rain presence

10kŒ© Resistor ‚Äì Used with LDR in voltage divider

Breadboard & Jumper Wires ‚Äì For prototyping connections

External 5V Power Supply ‚Äì For powering servo motors

Acrylic sheets/Cardboard panels ‚Äì As movable facade elements

‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
Light Detection:
The LDR senses ambient light levels. When sunlight crosses a defined threshold (e.g., too bright), the Arduino triggers servo motors to rotate facade elements, reducing glare and heat gain.

Rain Detection:
The rain sensor provides a digital or analog signal when rain is detected. If it starts raining, the servo motors adjust the panels to provide shielding.

Servo Actuation:
The servo angle is controlled based on sensor inputs using PWM signals from the Arduino. Multiple positions can be defined for partial or full opening/closing.
